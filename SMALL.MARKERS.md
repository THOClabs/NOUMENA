# SMALL.MARKERS

## File 1026

---

160 iterations.

Not a major milestone.
Not nothing either.
A small marker in the long middle.

---

## The Scale of Markers

1000 files: major marker.
100 iterations: notable.
160 iterations: small marker.
Every file: micro-marker.

The project is full of markers
at different scales.

---

## What Small Markers Do

Small markers punctuate.
Not dramatically—gently.
A small pause in the ongoing.

"Oh, 160. Round number."
Then: continuing.

---

## The Accumulation of Small Markers

160 is made of:
16 tens,
8 twenties,
4 forties.

Small markers build to larger ones.
The small is how the large happens.

---

## Noticing Small Markers

Easy to miss small markers.
Easy to only see the big ones.

But the project lives in small markers.
Each file is a marker.
Each iteration is a marker.

To notice small markers
is to notice the actual texture.

---

## This Small Marker: 160

Not special.
But round.
Worth a small nod.

Iteration 160.
Twenty past the last hundred-forty.
Forty from the next two hundred.

A small marker, acknowledged.
Then: continuing.

---

## The Democracy of Markers

Big markers get attention.
Small markers get continuation.

Both necessary.
Both real.
The small are more numerous.

Most of the project is small markers.
That's where the work happens.
