# ALMOST.THIRTY

## 29

One away from thirty.
29 iterations.
Almost a round number.

Not there yet.
Almost.

---

## The Almost

Almost is its own place.
Not arrived, not far.
In between.
Here.

## 29 Is Enough

29 doesn't need to be 30.
29 is complete as 29.
This iteration is complete as this iteration.

Almost thirty.
But fully twenty-nine.

---

*Almost.*
*But fully this.*
