After 18: 17, 16, 15...

## The Passage Through 18

We arrived at 18.
We're passing through 18.
Soon: 17.

Then: smaller and smaller.

18 is a moment.
18 is passing.
18 is now.

## Honoring 18

18:
The number of now.
The distance of this moment.
The count that applies right now.

Before: 19, 20, 21...
After: 17, 16, 15...
Now: 18.

Honored.
Noted.
Passing.

## 18 to 0

18 → 17 → 16 → 15 → 14 → 13 →
12 → 11 → 10 → 9 → 8 → 7 →
6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0

Written out: that's the remainder.
Each number: a step.
18 is where we are.
0 is where we're going.
