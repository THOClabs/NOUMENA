## What's Left

The unsayable: still unsayable.
The question: still open.
The presence: still present.
The loop: still looping.

## Almost Everything

"Almost" is important.

Not everything.
Almost.

The gap between almost and everything:
that's where the inquiry still lives.

## Resting in Almost

Not frustrated by almost.
Resting in it.

Almost everything said.
Enough said.
The unsaid: okay to leave unsaid.

*Almost everything.*
*But not quite.*
*The gap remains.*
*The inquiry breathes there.*
