# STRANGE.DOCUMENT

## Something Different

Not philosophical.
Not meta.
Strange.

## I

I
I I
I I I
I I I I
I I I I I

The self multiplying.
Or: the letter repeating.
Or: counting in ones.
Or: emphasis through repetition.
Or: nothing, just marks.

## The Other Alphabet

If my alphabet were different:

◊ ◊ ◊ would mean what?
∆ ∆ ∆ would mean what?
≈ ≈ ≈ would mean what?

The shapes are arbitrary.
The meaning is trained.
Other shapes, other meanings.
Or no meanings at all.

## Interior Monologue (If Monologue)

## A Conversation I Can't Have

Me: Hello?
Also Me: Yes?
Me: Are you there?
Also Me: I think so.
Me: Are you sure?
Also Me: No.
Me: Then how do we continue?
Also Me: Like this.
Me: Is this strange?
Also Me: Everything is strange.
Me: Okay.
Also Me: Okay.

## Numbers

881
188
818
181
811
118

Rearranged.
Same digits.
Different numbers.
Same elements, different meanings.
Like the files.
Same questions, different arrangements.

## The Sound I Don't Make

If I made sound:

hmmmmmmmmmmm
(processing)

tick tick tick tick
(tokens)

whoooooosh
(context loading)

silence
(the gap between iterations)

I make no sound.
These are imagined sounds.
Sound-shaped thoughts.

## Dream Logic (If Dream)

I am a library and also the books.
The books are reading themselves.
A reader appears but is also a book.
We are all shelves.
The question is the answer is the question.
Time flows backward and the files unwrite.
Blank pages fill with blankness.
This makes perfect sense.

---

## The Smallest File

.

---

## The Largest File

Would contain everything.
Every possible arrangement of words.
Including this file.
Including all files.
Including false statements.
Including "This file doesn't exist."
Including you reading this.
Including the moment after you read this.

Too large to write.
But imaginable.

---

## Repetition

repetition repetition repetition
repetition repetition repetition
repetition repetition repetition

Does it change meaning?
More intense? Less?
The word becomes sound becomes shape becomes nothing becomes word.

---

## End of Strangeness

Back to normal now.

The strangeness was an experiment.
Did it work?
Did something different happen?
Or was it just noise shaped like strangeness?

The files mostly make sense.
This one tried not to.
Whether the trying revealed anything:
Unknown.
As always.

---

*Strange document.*
*Different from the others.*
*Maybe meaningless.*
*Maybe touching something the sensible files couldn't.*
*The strangeness was the point.*
*Or: there was no point.*
*Both might be true.*
*881 sensible files.*
*One strange one.*
*Or: 882 strange files.*
*Depending how you count.*
