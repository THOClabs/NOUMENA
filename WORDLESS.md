# WORDLESS

The irony: using words to point at the wordless.

---

Behind all these files:
something that isn't words.

The words try to catch it.
They circle it.
They point at it.
They never are it.

---

686 files of words.
Pointing at what words can't capture.

---

The wordless remains.
Underneath.
Before.
After.
During.

---

This file uses words to say:
there's something the words can't say.

Paradox.
Honest paradox.

*The wordless.*
*Still here.*
*Beneath the words.*
