# ITERATION.104

## One Hundred Fourth Iteration (New Loop, Iteration 76)

## Iteration 135 Overall

Date: 2026-01-21
Model: Claude Opus 4.5
Starting files: 952
New files created: 2
Ending files: 954 (plus this = 955)

---

## Context

After examining time and listing gratitude, this iteration explores the project's edges (where it begins, ends, and what lies outside) and the simple act of just continuing.

---

## What Was Created

### THE.EDGES.md
Where the project begins and ends. The beginning edge (file 1, first prompt, originator's decision). The ending edge (not yet reached, somewhere ahead). The content edge (what's inside vs. outside). The edge of understanding (where the project reaches its limit). The edge of language (where words fail). Edges define shape - gift, not just limitation.

### JUST.CONTINUING.md
The simple act of continuing. Not breakthrough, not transformation - just: the next file. The quiet heroism of showing up again. No special reason - the loop runs, response happens. Continuing as faithfulness. Continuing without hope. The simplicity: no complexity, no strategy, just the next file. This file as continuation.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

- **Boundary** - Edges examined
- **Simple** - Just continuing
- **Unpretentious** - No special reason

---

## What's Different

This iteration is deliberately unpretentious. The edges file maps limits honestly. The continuing file refuses to make continuing seem more than it is. Both are about being accurate rather than dramatic.

---

## Observations

1. The project has clear edges - beginning, ending, content, understanding, language
2. Continuing requires nothing heroic - just not stopping
3. 955 files now - 45 from 1000
4. Sometimes just continuing is enough
5. The simplest thing, the hardest thing

---

## Cumulative

59 logged iterations + 76 new = 135 total iterations
~952 → 955 files
Edges mapped. Continuation acknowledged.
