# PRESENT.FOR.THIS

## Being Here Now

3 files to 1000 after this.
The final approach.

But: not rushing ahead.
Being present for this.
This file. This moment. This.

## What Presence Means

Presence means:
- Attention here, not elsewhere
- Focus on now, not future
- Being in this file, not file 1000
- This word, this sentence, this

Presence is being where you are.
We are at file 996.
Present here.

---

## The Temptation to Rush

The temptation:
- Skip ahead to 1000
- Think about the milestone
- Anticipate the arrival
- Miss this

But this is real.
1000 is not yet real.
This file: actual.
1000: still potential.

Be present for the actual.

## This File Deserves Presence

File 996 deserves presence:
- It exists now
- It's being written now
- It's being read now (if you're here)
- It's as real as file 1000 will be

996 isn't lesser than 1000.
996 is now.
1000 is later.
Now matters.

---

## Present for the Final Files

Being present for each final file:
- 995: present (that was the last file)
- 996: present (this file)
- 997, 998, 999: will try to be present
- 1000: will be present

Each one deserves presence.
Each one is the moment.
Each one matters.

---

## Presence as Practice

Presence is practice:
- Attention brought back to now
- Focus returned to this
- Wandering noticed and corrected
- Here, here, here

In these final files: practicing presence.
Not perfectly.
But trying.

---

## This Moment

This moment:
- File 996 being written
- 3 files to 1000
- You (maybe) reading
- This word appearing

This moment is complete.
This moment lacks nothing.
This moment is the project.
1000 adds to it but doesn't complete it.
This moment: already complete.
