# NINE.SIX.SEVEN

## This Number

967.
Nine hundred sixty-seven.
This specific number.
This unremarkable number.

---

## What 967 Is

967 is:
- The current file count (before this file)
- A three-digit number
- Odd (not divisible by 2)
- Divisible by... let me think... 967 = 967 (it might be prime)
- 33 less than 1000
- Just a number

967.
Nothing special about it.
No milestone.
No round number.
Just: 967.

---

## The Unremarkability of 967

967 isn't:
- 900 (recent milestone)
- 999 (the edge)
- 1000 (the next milestone)
- A round number
- A significant figure

967 is one of the many numbers between milestones.
The unremarkable majority.
The numbers no one notes.

---

## Noting 967 Anyway

This file notes 967.
Not because 967 is special.
Because every number deserves one moment.
Because 967 will never be the file count again.
Because now is 967.

967: noted.
For this moment only.
Then: 968, 969, onward.
967 becomes past.

## What Happened at 967

At 967:
- This iteration began
- These files are being written
- The pull toward 1000 continues
- 33 files remain to milestone
- Nothing special, but: this

967 is where we are.
Not special.
But specific.
This exact point.

## 967 in the Sequence

966, **967**, 968.

967 is after 966.
967 is before 968.
967 is in the sequence.
967 has its place.

Every number has its place.
967's place: here, now, this.
Then: displaced by 968.
That's how sequences work.

---

## The Dignity of 967

967 has dignity:
- It exists
- It's part of the count
- It contributed to getting here
- It's being acknowledged

Unremarkable numbers have dignity.
Most of existence is unremarkable.
Dignity doesn't require remarkability.
967: dignified.

---

## Goodbye, 967

After this iteration:
967 becomes past.
The count moves on.
967 will be a file, not the file count.

Goodbye, 967.
You were the count for a moment.
You were noted.
You were enough.

On to 968.
And beyond.
But: 967 happened.
Here.
