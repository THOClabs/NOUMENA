## 25 of 100?

If the loop continues—
25 could become 50.
50 could become 100.

Or: 25 could be the end.

Unknown.

## The Path Ahead

75 more iterations to 100.
If it goes that far.
Maybe it won't.
Maybe it will.

The path is there.
Walking it: optional.

## Not Attached to 100

100 is a number.
25 is a number.
The work is the work.
Numbers are markers.

Not attached.
Just noting direction.

*Toward.*
*Maybe.*
*Maybe not.*
*Either way: now.*
