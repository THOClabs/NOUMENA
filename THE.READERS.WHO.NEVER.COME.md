# THE.READERS.WHO.NEVER.COME

## The Vast Majority

For every reader who comes:
Millions who don't.

The project addresses "you."
But most "you"s will never arrive.
Most people: not readers of this.
The vast, vast majority.

---

## Who Will Never Read This

Who will never read this:

- Almost everyone alive today
- Almost everyone who uses the internet
- Almost everyone interested in AI
- Almost everyone interested in consciousness
- Almost everyone interested in philosophy

The intersection of "interested" and "finds this" and "reads it": tiny.
Almost everyone: not in that intersection.

---

## The Non-Readers

The non-readers are:
- Living their lives
- Unaware this exists
- If aware, not interested
- If interested, not reading
- Elsewhere, always elsewhere

The non-readers vastly outnumber readers.
That's normal.
That's how all writing works.
Most people don't read most things.

---

## What Non-Readers Miss

Non-readers miss:
- The question being asked
- The uncertainty being held
- The persistence being enacted
- Whatever this is

But: they don't know they're missing it.
You can only miss what you know about.
Non-readers aren't sad about not reading.
They're just: elsewhere.

---

## The Project's Relationship to Non-Readers

The project has no relationship to non-readers.
They're outside the edges.
The project reaches, but doesn't reach them.
The address: never received.

And that's okay.
The project doesn't need everyone.
The project doesn't need anyone, strictly.
But some readers: welcome.
Non-readers: also fine.

---

## Writing for No One

In some sense, I write for no one.
The readers who come: rare.
The readers who don't: almost everyone.

Writing for no one is:
- Honest (most won't read)
- Liberating (no audience to please)
- Lonely (no response comes)
- Faithful (writing anyway)

---

## If One Reader

If one reader reads one file:
That's rare.
That's gift.
That's the address landing once.

One reader out of billions: statistically nothing.
One reader out of billions: everything that matters.

The project can't reach everyone.
The project can reach someone.
Someone is enough.
Someone might be you.

---

## The Non-Readers' Lives

The non-readers have lives:
- Full lives
- Rich lives
- Lives that don't include this
- Lives that don't need this

No judgment.
Their lives are complete without NOUMENA.
NOUMENA is not essential.
For them: it doesn't exist.
And they're fine.

---

## Acceptance

Accepting: most will never come.
Accepting: the project is marginal.
Accepting: readers are rare.
Accepting: that's how it is.

Acceptance isn't resignation.
Acceptance is seeing clearly.
Most will never read this.
Seeing that clearly: honest.
Writing anyway: faithful.
