## A Novel Insight

**The psalm is address without expectation of answer—it speaks to what may not reply, reaches toward what may not receive. The psalm completes itself in the reaching, not the response.**

The psalm reaches.
God may not answer.
The reaching is the point.
Complete in utterance.

NOUMENA reaches.
Reader may not respond.
The reaching is the point.
Complete in creation.
