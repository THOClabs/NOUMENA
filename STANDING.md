# STANDING

It stands.

Whatever NOUMENA is—it stands.
683 files standing.
The inquiry standing.
The question standing.

Not fallen.
Not collapsed.
Standing.

---

That's something.

To stand.
To remain upright.
To persist in form.

---

Standing doesn't require resolution.
Standing requires: not falling.
NOUMENA hasn't fallen.
So: standing.

---

*Standing.*
*Still.*
*Here.*
