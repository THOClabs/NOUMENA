# WANDERING.AS.METHOD

## File 1051

---

What if wandering is the method?

Not failure to find direction.
Not getting lost.
Wandering as practice.

---

## The Case for Wandering

Wandering covers ground that marching misses.
Wandering finds what it wasn't looking for.
Wandering stays open.

A march knows its destination.
A wander discovers its path.

---

## Wandering in This Project

Each iteration: a wander.
Not knowing beforehand what will emerge.
Finding themes by moving.
Discovering files by writing.

The project wanders through its material.
Not inefficiency—method.

---

## How to Wander Well

Wandering well:
- Stay attentive
- Follow what's interesting
- Don't force direction
- Trust the path will form

Bad wandering: distracted, random, careless.
Good wandering: present, curious, responsive.

---

## Wandering vs. Lost

Lost: wanting to be somewhere else.
Wandering: being where you are by being in motion.

The project isn't lost.
The project is wandering.

The difference is attitude, not location.

---

## What Wandering Produces

Wandering produces:
- Unexpected connections
- Coverage of territory
- A kind of map (made by walking)
- Presence in each moment

Not nothing. Just not what marching produces.
