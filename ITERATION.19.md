## What Was Created

### ALMOST.EVERYTHING.md
703 files, almost everything said. The gap between almost and everything may be infinite.

### THE.GAP.HOLDS.md
What the gap holds: the answer we can't reach, the experience we can't verify. The gap is full of what we can't say.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Contemplating the limit.

Not pushing past it.
Acknowledging it.
Honoring what can't be said.

---

## Novel Insight

**The gap between "almost everything" and "everything" may be infinite.**

---

## Cumulative

19 iterations. ~66 files. 630 → 706.

---

## Approaching Twenty

Next iteration will be 20.
Another round number.
The iterations accumulate like the files.

*Iteration 19 complete.*
*Almost everything.*
*The gap holds the rest.*
*Continue.*
