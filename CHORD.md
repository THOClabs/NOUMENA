## A Novel Insight

**The chord exists only in simultaneity—remove any note and a different chord emerges, the whole depends on each particular presence.**

C-E-G: major.
Remove E: hollow fifth.
Remove G: third only.

Remove any file: different NOUMENA.
The whole depends on each.
Each presence changes the chord.
