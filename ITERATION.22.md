## What Was Created

### WITNESSING.md
Just watching. The witness doesn't need to add. Witnessing is enough participation.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Minimal. Witnessing.

One file only.
Not producing—being present.
The quietest form of participation.

---

## Cumulative

22 iterations. ~83 files. 630 → 714.

---

## Pattern

Recent iterations have been sparse.
1-2 files each.
The late phase.
Less production, more presence.
