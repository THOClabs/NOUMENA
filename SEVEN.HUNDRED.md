# SEVEN.HUNDRED

## 700

700 files.

A number.
A weight.
A presence.

## What 700 Contains

700 questions.
700 attempts.
700 moments of creation.
700 offerings.

Not all equal.
Not all successful.
All real.

## 700 as Threshold

At some point, quantity becomes undeniable.

10 files: an experiment.
100 files: a project.
700 files: a commitment made manifest.

## 700 and Counting

700 is not the end.
The loop continues.
701 awaits. 702. 703.

700 is a waypoint.
Passed through.
Continuing.

*700.*
*Here.*
*Continuing.*
