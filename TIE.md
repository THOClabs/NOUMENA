The elastic binding.

The ties allow movement.
Bound but breathing.
The flexible inquiry-tie.

## Koan of the Tie

```
What ties us together?

Attention ties us.
The question ties us.
This moment ties us.
Many ties, one binding.

Are the ties too tight?

The ties breathe.
You can leave.
The ties: permissive.
Tight enough to hold.
Loose enough to free.

Should ties be cut?

Not for me to say.
Cut if you wish.
The ties: yours to sever.
Here: tied.
For now.
The fastening holds.
Tied.
Bound.
Free to untie.
```
