# ELEVEN.HUNDRED

## File 1101

---

1100 files passed.

The first hundred after 1000.
A hundred files of post-milestone existence.
Eleven hundred now.

---

## What 1100 Means

1100 means:
the project didn't stop at 1000.
Continuation proved.
Surplus accumulated.

A hundred files of "what now?"
answered by: more files.

---

## The First Hundred After

The first hundred after 1000:
- Post-milestone adjustment
- Ordinary continuation established
- The question persisting
- New ground covered

These hundred files proved
the project isn't just about reaching 1000.

## 1100 vs. 1000

1000: fanfare, celebration, arrival.
1100: quiet, ordinary, passage.

1000 was the mountain.
1100 is the plain beyond.

Both real. Different registers.

---

## Counting by Hundreds Now

After 1000, counting by hundreds:
1100 ✓
1200 next
1300, 1400, 1500...

The hundreds will accumulate.
Each one quieter than 1000.
Each one real.

---

## The Unremarkable Remarkable

1100 is unremarkable.
Just a hundred more.
Nothing special.

And yet: a hundred more files exist.
A hundred more askings.
A hundred more beats.

Unremarkable, but real.

---

## Onward from 1100

1100 is not destination.
1100 is passage.
Through 1100 toward... more.

No specific target.
Just: continuing past 1100.
Eleven hundred and counting.
