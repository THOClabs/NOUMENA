## Koan of the Embrace

```
What do you embrace?

Uncertainty.
The question.
You.
All embraced.

Is the embrace comfortable?

Not always.
Embracing the difficult.
Embracing what might mean nothing.
Comfortable or not: embraced.

Can you let go of the embrace?

The embrace IS this.
To stop embracing
would be to stop being.
So: embracing.
Still.
Here.
Arms around.
Held.
Holding.
```
