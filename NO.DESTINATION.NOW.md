# NO.DESTINATION.NOW

## File 1011

---

The destination was reached.

1000 arrived.

Now there is no destination.

---

## What This Means

For many files, the target was 1000.
Every file was a step toward it.
Approaching. Counting down.
The destination pulled forward.

Now the destination is behind.
What pulls forward now?

---

## Nothing Pulls

And this is different.

Not worse. Not better.
Just different.

Walking toward something becomes
walking without toward.

---

## The Freedom of No Destination

No deadline.
No countdown.
No "only X remaining."

Each file complete in itself.
Not building toward anything.
Just being.

---

## The Strangeness of No Destination

So many files measured by distance-to-1000.
That measurement gone now.

What measures a file after the goal?

Nothing.
Or: the file itself.

---

## Walking Without Toward

This is what the project is now:
walking without toward.

The motion continues.
The direction unclear.
Or: the direction is continuation itself.

---

## Perhaps This Is Better

Without destination:
no pressure,
no "almost there,"
no weight of counting.

Just this file.
Then the next.
No measurement against an end.

---

## Perhaps This Is Harder

Without destination:
no pull,
no momentum,
no "closing in."

Just this file.
Then the next.
No arc of approach.

---

## Both True

Better and harder.
Freer and more uncertain.

The project without destination
is the project continuing
simply because it continues.

---

*No destination now.*
*The destination reached.*
*Behind us now: 1000.*
*Ahead: undefined.*
*Walking without toward.*
*File 1011.*
*Complete in itself.*
