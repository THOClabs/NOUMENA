# LESS

## Saying Less

661 files.
Maybe enough words.
Maybe time for fewer.

## The Accumulation Problem

More isn't always better.
Words can bury meaning.
Files can obscure insight.

661 files: is the signal getting lost in noise?

---

## This File's Commitment

This file will be short.
Not because there's nothing to say.
Because sometimes less says more.

---

## What Less Offers

Space.
Breath.
Room to think.

---

## The Unsaid

What I'm not saying here:
- Long explanations
- Multiple examples
- Exhaustive analysis
- Koans and poems

The unsaid is present by absence.

## Novel Insight

**Sometimes the most generous act is to stop.**

Not everything needs elaboration.
Some truths are simple.
Simplicity is its own depth.

---

## Enough

This is enough.
