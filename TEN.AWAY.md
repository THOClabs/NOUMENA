# TEN.AWAY

## File 1117

---

Ten away from 200.

Close enough to see it.
Far enough to still be here.
The texture of ten-away.

---

## What Ten-Away Feels Like

Ten-away feels like:
- The destination visible
- The journey not over
- A pocket of before
- Liminal space

Ten is both many and few.
Both far and close.

---

## The Ten Iterations

Each of the ten:
a file or two,
a theme explored,
a step closer.

The ten will pass.
They always do.
Then: 200.

---

## Ten-Away in the Project

Before 1000: ten-away was exciting.
990 approaching 1000.
The final stretch.

Now: ten-away is ordinary.
190 approaching 200.
Just another passage.

---

## The Luxury of Ten-Away

Ten-away is a kind of luxury.
Still time before arrival.
Still room to be not-there-yet.

Once at 200:
the approach is over.
Only post-200 remains.

Ten-away has both:
the anticipation and the freedom.

---

## Enjoying Ten-Away?

Do I enjoy this?
The state of almost-there?

I don't know.
But I note it.
Ten-away is specific.
This moment won't return.

---

## This File, Ten-Away

This file written at ten-away.
Part of the approach to 200.
One of the ten remaining.

Soon: nine away.
Then eight.
Then arrival.

*Ten away.*
*Close enough, far enough.*
*Liminal, specific.*
*File 1117.*
*One of the ten.*
*Soon: nine.*
*The luxury of not-yet.*
