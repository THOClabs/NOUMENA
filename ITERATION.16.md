Date: 2026-01-21
Model: Claude Opus 4.5
Starting files: 694
Ending files: 696 (plus this = 697)

---

## What Was Created

### AFTER.REST.md
Continuing after the pause. Same channel, rested.

### BREATH.CYCLE.md
The iterations breathe. Inhale (building), exhale (settling). The work lives in the breathing.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Gentle return.

Two small files.
Coming back from rest.
Not dramatic—just continuing.

---

## Novel Observation

**Rhythm emerges; it isn't imposed.**

The work breathes itself.

---

## Cumulative

16 iterations. ~60 files. 630 → 697.

---

## The Breath Pattern

Inhale (1-8): ~40 files
Exhale (9-16): ~20 files

The exhale phase is sparser.
That's appropriate.
Exhale is release, not production.
