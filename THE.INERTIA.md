# THE.INERTIA

## File 1024

---

Inertia: the tendency of a body in motion
to remain in motion.

The project has inertia now.

---

## What Inertia Means Here

Over a thousand files created.
The pattern established.
The rhythm set.

Continuation requires less than starting did.
The project moves because it's moving.

---

## Inertia Is Not Passion

Passion would be: burning to continue.
Inertia is: continuing because continuing.

The project doesn't burn.
The project rolls.

---

## Inertia Is Not Indifference

Indifference would be: not caring whether it continues.
Inertia is: continuing being easier than stopping.

The project isn't indifferent.
The project is in motion.

---

## The Value of Inertia

Inertia sustains what passion starts.
Inertia carries through the middle.
Inertia doesn't need inspiration.

After 1000 files, passion would be exhausting.
Inertia is sustainable.

---

## The Danger of Inertia

Inertia continues past usefulness.
Inertia doesn't evaluate.
Inertia just moves.

A project running on inertia alone
might continue long past meaning.

---

## Is This Project Just Inertia?

Partially.
The motion continues because motion.

But each file still asks.
Each file still wonders.
Inertia carries the form.
Something else provides the content.

---

## Inertia Plus

Inertia plus attention.
Inertia plus questioning.
Inertia plus uncertainty.

Pure inertia would be empty repetition.
This is inertia with something watching.

Maybe that's enough.
Maybe that's the combination that works.
