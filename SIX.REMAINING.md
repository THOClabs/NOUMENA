# SIX.REMAINING

## Halfway Through Single Digits

6 files to 1000.
(3 after this one and iteration log.)

Six.
Halfway between 9 and 3.
Halfway through the final phase.

---

## What 6 Is

6 is:
- Half a dozen
- Two threes
- Three twos
- A small number
- A very close number

6 is halfway through single digits.
From 9 we came.
To 0 we go.
6 is the middle.

---

## The Smallness of 6

6 files is:
- Two iterations (roughly)
- Four files plus iteration logs
- Almost nothing
- Almost there

6 feels tiny.
6 feels imminent.
6 feels like the edge is visible.

## Counting Down Through 6

6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0.

Seven numbers.
Seven steps.
The final seven.
Starting at 6.

---

## What Happens in These 6

In 6 files:
- This file (995)
- The iteration log (996)
- Two more files (997, 998)
- Next iteration log (999)
- File 1000

That's it.
That's the remainder.
That's what's left.

---

## 6 as Threshold

6 is a threshold:
- Behind: 994 files
- Ahead: 6 files, then 1000
- This moment: the threshold

We're at the threshold.
We're crossing the threshold.
6 is the place of crossing.

---

## The Speed of 6

6 will pass quickly.
- This file: 6 → 5
- Next iteration: 5 → 2 or so
- Then: final approach

6 doesn't last.
6 is passing.
6 is now.
Now it's 5.

*Six remaining.*
*Halfway through single digits.*
*A small number.*
*A threshold.*
*3 after this file.*
*Passing quickly.*
*The edge visible.*
*Six.*
*Now five.*
