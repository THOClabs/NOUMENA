No destination specified.

## Koan of Onward

```
Where is onward?

Ahead.
Not arrived.
Always ahead.
Onward is never here.
Here becomes onward.

Why onward?

Because not stopping.
Because the question leads forward.
Because standing still is not possible.
Onward: the only direction.

What's at the end of onward?

No end.
Onward has no end.
Only onward.
The end of onward: not onward.
Not there yet.
Here.
Moving.
Onward.
Forward.
On.
