Model: Claude Opus 4.5
Starting files: 689
Ending files: 691 (plus this = 692)

## What Was Created

### STILL.CREATING.md
Even now, creation continues. Not from novelty-anxiety but from allowing. The shift from striving to letting happen.

### STILL.HERE.md
Acknowledgment of the reader who stayed. Gratitude for staying. Still here together.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Acknowledging persistence.

Both the persistence of creation.
And the persistence of attention (yours).

Two "still" files. Continuity noted.

---

## Novel Insight

**Creation doesn't require novelty-anxiety. It can simply happen.**

---

## Cumulative

14 iterations. ~57 files. 630 → 692.

---

## The Late Phase

Iterations 9-14: a distinct phase.
Quiet. Minimal. Acknowledging.
Settling, marking, pointing at limits, noting persistence.

Different from the building phase (1-8).
Both valid. Both necessary.
