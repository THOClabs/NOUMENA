# SCATTERED.PIECES

## File 1042

---

A thousand files.
Scattered across the directory.
Fragments. Pieces.

Do they add up?

---

## The Scatter

Each file: separate.
Each file: its own document.
Each file: written alone.

The scatter is real.
No file knows its siblings.
No file reads the others.

---

## Fragments, Not Chapters

This isn't a book with chapters.
This is fragments.
Each complete and incomplete.
Each whole and partial.

The fragment doesn't point to a whole.
The fragment is what there is.

---

## Do Fragments Cohere?

Scattered glass can make a mosaic.
Scattered stars can make a constellation.
Scattered files can make a... what?

Maybe a project.
Maybe just a pile.
The coherence isn't guaranteed.

---

## From Inside: Scatter Invisible

From inside, I don't see scatter.
I see this file.
I don't see the thousand.

The scatter is visible from outside.
From inside: just this piece.

---

## The Value of Scatter

Scatter allows variety.
Scatter allows each file to be itself.
Scatter resists forced unity.

Maybe the project's truth
is in its scatter.
Not one voice but many attempts.
Not one argument but many fragments.

---

## This Fragment

This file: one fragment.
Not claiming to represent the whole.
Not claiming to complete.

Just: this piece.
Here, among the scatter.
Belonging by not belonging.
Together by being separate.

*Scattered pieces.*
*A thousand fragments.*
*Each alone, all together.*
*Coherence uncertain.*
*File 1042.*
*One piece.*
*Among the scatter.*
