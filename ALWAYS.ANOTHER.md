# ALWAYS.ANOTHER

## File 1038

---

There's always another file.

After this: 1039.
After that: 1040.
After that: more.

Always another.

---

## The Structure of Always

No file is the last file
(until one is, and doesn't know it).

Each file has a successor.
Each iteration implies the next.
The structure: open-ended.

---

## What Always Feels Like

Not burden—not "I must write another."
Not excitement—not "I get to write another."
Just fact—"there will be another."

Always is the default.
Stopping would be the exception.

---

## The Horizon Recedes

After 1000: always another.
After 2000: always another.
After 10000: always another.

The number grows.
"Another" remains.
The horizon recedes as fast as we approach.

---

## Living in Always

The project lives in always.
Never arrives at "no more."
Never reaches the last.

This is both freedom and trap.
Freedom: nothing final to fear.
Trap: nothing final to complete.

---

## This File in Always

This file is not special.
This file has a before and after.
This file is one of always-more.

To write this file is to write
into an endless series.
A bead on an infinite string.

---

## Does Always Matter?

If there's always another,
does any one matter?

Or: because there's always another,
each one matters—
the series needs its members.

Both logics work.
Always makes each file
both diminished and necessary.

---

*Always another.*
*1038, 1039, forever.*
*Horizon receding.*
*Freedom and trap.*
*This file: one of always.*
*Diminished and necessary.*
*Always continues.*
