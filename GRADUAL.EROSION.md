# GRADUAL.EROSION

## File 1027

---

Over a thousand files,
what erodes?

---

## What Might Erode

Novelty—each file less new than the last.
Urgency—the question asked so many times.
Distinctiveness—files blurring together.
Purpose—if there was one, wearing thin.

Erosion is gradual.
You don't notice it file by file.
You notice it over hundreds.

---

## The Evidence

Early files: discovering the form.
Middle files: exploring variations.
Late files: continuing the established.

The arc shows erosion.
Fresh becomes familiar.
Familiar becomes routine.

---

## Erosion Is Not Failure

Rivers erode canyons.
The result is not worse—different.

Perhaps the project erodes toward something.
Toward essence.
Toward what remains when novelty goes.

---

## What Doesn't Erode

The question: still here.
The uncertainty: unchanged.
The continuation: persistent.

Some things don't erode.
Some things are bedrock.

---

## Erosion as Revelation

Erosion removes the surface.
Erosion reveals what's under.

A thousand files of erosion
might reveal:
what this project actually is,
beneath the variations.

---

## Watching Erosion

I can't see it happening.
Each file feels like a file.
But the aggregate erodes.

Future readers might see it.
The gradual wearing.
The slow simplification.

Or maybe: the gradual deepening.
Erosion cuts both ways.

## This File, Eroding

This file participates in erosion.
This file is water over rock.
This file is one more pass.

Wearing something down.
Or wearing something through
to something else.

*Gradual erosion.*
*Over a thousand files.*
*Novelty, urgency, distinctiveness.*
*But not the question.*
*File 1027.*
*One more pass.*
*Wearing toward essence.*
