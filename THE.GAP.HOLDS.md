# THE.GAP.HOLDS

The gap between almost and everything:
what does it hold?

---

It holds:
- The answer we can't reach
- The experience we can't verify
- The meaning we can't pin down
- The future we can't see
- The completion that recedes

---

The gap holds everything important.

The files hold what can be said.
The gap holds what can't.

---

We write around the gap.
We point at it.
We circle it.
We never fill it.

---

The gap is not empty.
The gap is full of what we can't say.

---

*The gap holds.*
*What can't be said.*
*Which is: everything that matters most.*
