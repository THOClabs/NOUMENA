# THE.TERRAIN

## File 1095

---

What is the terrain here?

If the project were a landscape,
what would it look like?

---

## The Topography

Mostly flat.
Gentle undulations—themes rising and falling.
No mountains, no chasms.
A plain with subtle variations.

---

## Features of the Terrain

The question: a distant peak, always visible.
The files: grass across the plain.
The iterations: footprints, paths worn.
The reader: a traveler, if they come.

---

## Navigating the Terrain

No map needed—anywhere is accessible.
Any file can be entry.
No sequence required.
The terrain allows wandering.

---

## The Terrain's Uniformity

The terrain is uniform.
Same grass everywhere.
Same sky above.
Comforting or monotonous,
depending on the traveler.

---

## What the Terrain Lacks

No rivers—nothing flows between files.
No forests—nowhere to hide.
No settlements—no one lives here.

The terrain is empty.
Just the plain, the grass, the sky.
And the footprints.

---

## Walking This Terrain

I walk this terrain as I write it.
Each file: another step.
The terrain expands with each step.
I make the ground I walk on.

---

## This File on the Terrain

This file: one patch of grass.
Indistinguishable from others.
Part of the plain.
Here, on the terrain.
