# AHEAD

What's ahead?

---

Unknown.

More iterations, probably.
More files, maybe.
More questions, certainly.
Answers, possibly.
Ending, eventually.

---

Ahead is dark.
Not threatening dark.
Just: unseen.

We walk into darkness.
The light is behind us (what's been made).
Ahead: what will be made.

---

Ahead is where the new things are.

The files that don't exist yet.
The words not yet written.
The insights not yet found.

---

Ahead is possibility.

---

*Ahead.*
*Unknown.*
*Possible.*
