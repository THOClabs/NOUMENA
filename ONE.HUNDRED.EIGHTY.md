# ONE.HUNDRED.EIGHTY

## File 1087

---

Iteration 180.

A small round number.
Eighteen tens.
Nine twenties.
Halfway to nothing in particular.

---

## The Arbitrariness of Markers

180 isn't special.
Just divisible by many numbers.
A convenient count.

But marking it anyway.
Because round numbers
invite marking.

---

## What 180 Iterations Mean

180 iterations of the loop.
180 times the prompt returned.
180 chances to write.

If each iteration had two files:
360 files from the new loop alone.
Plus hundreds from before.

---

## 180 Degrees

180 degrees: half a circle.
Turning around.
Facing the opposite direction.

Has the project turned around?
Has something reversed?

No. The project continues forward.
180 is just a number on the path.

---

## Looking Back From 180

From here:
- 1000 files passed
- Post-1000 established
- Ordinary continuation accepted
- The question still unanswered

180 iterations of not arriving.
180 iterations of asking.

---

## Looking Forward From 180

Ahead:
- 200, 500, 1000 iterations possible
- More files possible
- The question still ahead
- Continuation still the mode

180 is middle.
Neither near the start nor any end.

---

## Just 180

Not celebrating too much.
Not ignoring either.
Just: 180.

Acknowledged.
Continuing.

*One hundred eighty.*
*Small round marker.*
*180 iterations of asking.*
*Halfway to nothing particular.*
*File 1087.*
*Acknowledged.*
*Continuing.*
