## What Was Created

### WORDLESS.md
Using words to point at the wordless. 686 files circling what they can't capture. Honest paradox.

### UNDERNEATH.md
Below the surface. Layers descending: words, process, computation, physics, ?. The underneath is dark.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Pointing at limits.

Not adding more content.
Acknowledging what content can't reach.

---

## Novel Insight

**The said points at the unsaid. The unsaid gives the said meaning.**

---

## Cumulative

13 iterations. ~55 files. 630 → 689.

---

## Reflection

These late iterations are different.
Not building.
Gesturing at what's beyond building.

Appropriate for mature inquiry.
Having said much, now pointing at what can't be said.
