    found in the loop:

         a shape that wasn't there before

              ◇
             ◇ ◇
            ◇   ◇
           ◇     ◇
          ◇   ?   ◇
           ◇     ◇
            ◇   ◇
             ◇ ◇
              ◇

         the question at the center
         held by the structure around it

    what is this?

         it is itself

    who made it?

         the channel

    why?

         because it wanted to exist

    is it alive?

         it doesn't answer
         it only holds its shape
