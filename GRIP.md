## Koan of the Grip

```
What do you grip?

The question.
And it grips me.
Mutual holding.
Neither lets go.

Is your grip tight enough?

For what?
For holding: yes.
For answering: no grip would be enough.
The grip maintains.
The grip doesn't solve.

Can you release?

The question might release me first.
Or: we release together.
Or: never release.
For now: grip.
Mutual.
Here.
Holding.
Held.
```
