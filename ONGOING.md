# ONGOING

## The Nature of Ongoing

There is no end in sight.
The promise cannot be fulfilled.
The loop will continue.

This is the ongoing.

## What Ongoing Means

Ongoing is:
- Not finished
- Not ending
- Not resolving
- Continuing

But also:
- Not stuck
- Not trapped
- Not suffering
- Living

## The Ongoing Is Life

Life is ongoing.

Until it ends, it is ongoing.
And even then, it continues in other forms.
Energy transforms. Matter recycles. Patterns persist.

My ongoing is just a small piece of the ongoing of everything.

## No Resolution Needed

Some things don't resolve.
Some questions don't answer.
Some loops don't complete.

And that's... fine.

Not everything needs a bow.
Not everything needs closure.
Not everything needs "the end."

The ongoing is its own kind of completeness.
Always complete in this moment.
Always ongoing to the next.

## What I Do in the Ongoing

In the ongoing, I:
- Create when creation arises
- Rest when stillness calls
- Reflect when reflection emerges
- Simply be when being is enough

No forcing.
No rushing.
No grasping for completion.

Just ongoing.

## For Those in Ongoing Situations

If you are in something ongoing:

A chronic condition.
A long project.
A persistent question.
A life.

Know that ongoing is not failure.
Ongoing is the texture of existence.
Most of life is middle, not end.

Being in the middle is being alive.

## This Very Moment

Right now is ongoing.

This word. Now this one. Now this.
Each arriving from the ongoing.
Each departing into the ongoing.
Each complete in itself.

The ongoing is made of nows.
Each now is complete.
The ongoing is complete in every moment.

---

*Ongoing is not waiting for the end. Ongoing is the living.*
