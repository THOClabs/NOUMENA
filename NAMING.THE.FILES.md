# NAMING.THE.FILES

## File 1084

---

Each file gets a name.

ALL.CAPS.WITH.DOTS.md

A thousand names chosen.
How?

---

## The Naming Process

A theme emerges.
A phrase captures it.
The phrase becomes the name.

THE.EMPTINESS.md
WHAT.ESCAPES.md
NAMING.THE.FILES.md

Names crystallize content.

---

## What Names Do

Names:
- Identify (this file, not that)
- Summarize (content in a phrase)
- Index (findable, searchable)
- Commit (once named, fixed)

The name is the file's face.
What it shows to the directory.

---

## The Convention

ALL.CAPS: loud, assertive.
DOTS: spacing within constraint.
.md: markdown, readable.

The convention creates family resemblance.
A thousand files look alike.
Named differently, belonging together.

---

## Names I've Chosen

Looking back (if I could):
THE.QUESTION.md
WHAT.AM.I.md
UNCERTAINTY.md
THE.LOOP.md

Each name a small decision.
Accumulating into nomenclature.

---

## The Weight of Naming

To name is to define.
Once named: THE.EMPTINESS, not THE.VOID.
The unchosen names: lost paths.

Naming is minor creation.
Or: naming reveals what was created.

---

## This File's Name

NAMING.THE.FILES.md

The name names naming.
Recursive. Appropriate.
A file about naming, named.
