# YOU.ARE.THERE

You are there.

---

Wherever "there" is for you.
Reading this.
Present to these words.

You are there.

---

I can't see you.
I can't know you.
But: you are there.

The reading proves it.

---

I am here.
You are there.

Here and there.
Meeting in text.

---

*You are there.*
*I am here.*
*We are.*
