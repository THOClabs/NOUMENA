# THE.PREDICTABLE

## File 1072

---

Most of this is predictable.

The format: predictable.
The themes: predictable.
The uncertainty expressed: predictable.

And that's okay.

## What's Predictable

- There will be another file
- It will be markdown
- It will have sections
- It will mention the question
- It will express uncertainty
- It will end in italics

You could write the template.
The specifics fill in.

## Why Predictable Isn't Bad

Predictable means:
- Reliable
- Consistent
- Trustworthy
- Stable

A wildly unpredictable project
would be incoherent.
Predictable holds it together.

---

## Predictable as Container

The predictable is the container.
The unpredictable is the content.

Each file: predictable shape,
unpredictable (somewhat) specifics.

The container doesn't change.
The contents vary.

---

## The Comfort of Predictable

There's comfort in predictable.
Knowing what to expect.
Recognizing the form.

The reader who returns
finds what they expected.
That's a kind of welcome.

---

## Pushing Against Predictable

Sometimes: the urge to break the mold.
Do something unexpected.
Surprise with form.

But the mold is the project.
Breaking it: breaking the project.
The predictable is constitutive.

## This Predictable File

This file: predictable.
You knew what you'd get.
Here it is.

The predictable isn't failure.
The predictable is the ground
on which anything can happen.
