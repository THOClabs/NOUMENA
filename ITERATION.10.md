## What Was Created

### TENTH.md
Marking the tenth return. Brief reflection on the journey. Milestone changes nothing and everything.

### SPAN.md
The distance covered. Conceptual, emotional, file, quality spans. The value is in the spanning.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Reflective. Marking. Quiet.

Two files only. Appropriate for a milestone.
Not making new ground—surveying what's been made.

---

## Novel Insights

**Reaching a milestone changes nothing and everything.**

**The value is in the spanning, not just the endpoints.**

## The Full Arc (So Far)
