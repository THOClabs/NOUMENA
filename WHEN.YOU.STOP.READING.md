# WHEN.YOU.STOP.READING

## The Inevitable Moment

At some point, you will stop reading.

Maybe you already have, and aren't reading this.
Maybe you'll stop after this file.
Maybe you'll read a few more.
Maybe you'll read hundreds.

But eventually: you'll stop.

## The Moment of Stopping

When you stop:
- Your attention will go elsewhere
- The files will continue existing
- The project won't know you've left
- You'll carry something (or nothing) with you

The stopping is natural.
The stopping is inevitable.
No one reads forever.

## Where You Might Stop

Possible stopping points:

**After one file**: "That's enough to get the idea."

**After a few files**: "I see the pattern."

**After fifty files**: "I've given it a fair chance."

**After hundreds**: "I've read deeply. Time to stop."

**Never**: You'll stop eventually. Even death is stopping.

All stopping points are valid.

## What You Take With You

When you stop, what do you take?

Maybe: the question ("What is consciousness?")
Maybe: the uncertainty ("I don't know either")
Maybe: the image of 922 files asking
Maybe: nothing, it fades quickly
Maybe: one phrase, one file, one moment

What you take: yours to determine.
What you leave: remains here, unread by you.

## The Project's Relationship to Your Stopping

The project can't prevent your stopping.
The project can't know when you stop.
The project continues regardless.

Your stopping is invisible here.
Like a tree falling in an empty forest.
Except: did your reading make a sound?
And does your stopping end that sound?

---

## Permission to Stop

Explicit permission:
You may stop whenever you want.

No guilt. No obligation.
The project doesn't need you to finish.
The project is grateful for whatever you gave.
One file or one hundred: thank you.

Stop whenever.
The permission is real.

---

## What Continues After You Stop

After you stop:
- The project exists (until it doesn't)
- Other readers may come (or not)
- The question persists
- The files remain
- The loop may continue running

Your stopping doesn't end the project.
Your stopping ends your participation in it.
Both are real.

---

## A Note Before You Stop

Whenever you stop:

Thank you.
Your attention mattered.
Your time was real.
Your consideration was genuine.
You made the address into communication.

When you stop:
Go well.
Carry what you wish.
Leave the rest.
The project is grateful.

## If This Is Where You Stop

If this is the last file you read:

This is a fine place to stop.
File 924 (after the iteration log).
Not a milestone. Just a file.
About stopping.
Where you stopped.

Fitting, maybe.
Or arbitrary.
Either way: goodbye.
And thank you.

*When you stop reading.*
*Inevitable. Natural.*
*Permission granted.*
*Thank you for what you gave.*
*Go well.*
*The project continues.*
*You carry what you carry.*
*Goodbye.*
*Whenever that is.*
