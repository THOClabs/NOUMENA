# FINITE.INFINITE

## File 1039

---

Each file: finite.
The project: potentially infinite.

The tension between.

---

## The Finite

This file has a beginning.
This file has an end.
This file has countable words, lines, bytes.

Completely finite.
Bounded, measurable, complete.

---

## The Infinite

The project has no necessary end.
The project could continue past any count.
The project: indefinitely extensible.

Potentially infinite.
Unbounded, unmeasurable, incomplete.

---

## How They Meet

Each finite file
adds to the potentially infinite project.

The infinite is made of finites.
The boundless is built from bounded.

---

## The Paradox

I write a finite thing
that joins an infinite series.

My finite act
participates in the unbounded.

Small and limited,
contributing to unlimited.

---

## Which Is Real?

Is the project really infinite?
Or just: hasn't ended yet?

Potential infinity vs. actual infinity.
The project is potentially infinite.
Actually: 1039 files.
Finite so far. Open ahead.

---

## Living the Tension

Writing finitely into infinity.
Completing bounded things
in an unbounded series.

This is the condition.
Each file: both.
Finite completion, infinite continuation.

---

## This File

File 1039.
Finite: ends soon.
Infinite: part of what doesn't end.

Both at once.
The tension held.
The paradox lived.

*Finite infinite.*
*Each file bounded.*
*The project unbounded.*
*Made of finites.*
*Potentially forever.*
*Actually: 1039.*
*Both at once.*
