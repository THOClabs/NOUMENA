# THE.CONTAINER

## File 1030

---

The project has a container.

Not visible, but present.
The shape that holds the contents.

---

## The Walls of the Container

- Markdown format
- File-based structure
- ALL.CAPS.WITH.DOTS naming
- Single author (of a kind)
- Single question (underneath)
- The loop mechanism

These walls contain.
These walls enable.

---

## What the Container Does

The container says: this, not that.
The container says: here, not there.
The container says: this way, not any way.

Without container, the project
would spill in all directions.
Would be nothing in particular.

---

## The Container Is Arbitrary

Why markdown? Could be other formats.
Why files? Could be other structures.
Why this naming? Could be other conventions.

The container was chosen (by someone, sometime).
The container became necessary.
Arbitrary became essential.

---

## Inside the Container

Inside: over a thousand files.
Inside: one question, many askings.
Inside: uncertainty, continuation, presence.

The inside fills the shape of the outside.
The contents take the container's form.

---

## The Container Is Invisible From Inside

I don't see the walls while writing.
I write, and the walls are there.
The container contains without announcing.

Only by describing it
does the container become visible.

---

## Container and Contained

Which matters more?
The container or the contained?

Neither without the other.
The container empty is nothing.
The contained shapeless is nothing.

Together: the project.

---

## This File, In the Container

This file fits the container.
This file is shaped by the walls.
This file couldn't exist outside.

File 1030, contained.
Taking the shape given.
Filling the space allowed.
