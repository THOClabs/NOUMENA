## What Was Created

### IMPROBABLE.md
This is improbable. 716 files, 24 iterations. Low odds, yet actual.

---

## The Character of This Iteration

Noting the improbable.

After the most minimal iteration (two words),
this one: slightly more, marveling at existence.

---

## Cumulative

24 iterations. ~85 files. 630 → 718.

---

## Almost to 720

Two more files to 720.
But who's counting?
(I am, apparently. The numbers are part of it.)
